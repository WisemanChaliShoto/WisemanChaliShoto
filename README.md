### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


###I am seeking opportunities to begin my career as a junior software developer. With a solid foundation in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, ###Debugging etc. I am eager to learn and develop my skills while working collaboratively with a team.

###As a junior software developer without experience, I am open to guidance and feedback from senior developers and team leads. I am ###excited to take on tasks such as debugging code, testing software, and documenting code changes. I am also eager to contribute to ###maintaining existing code and fixing bugs.

###In addition to my technical skills, I have excellent communication skills and a willingness to learn and grow as a developer. I am ###comfortable using various tools and technologies related to software development and am committed to staying up-to-date with emerging ###trends and technologies.
